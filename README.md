# KnowUREnvironment
 
Despite climate change being one of the greatest threats to humanity, many people are still in denial or lack motivation for appropriate action. A structured source of knowledge can help increase public awareness while also helping crucial natural language understanding tasks such as information retrieval, question answering, and recommendation systems. We introduce \emph{KnowUREnvironment} -- a knowledge graph for climate change and related environmental issues, extracted from the scientific literature. We automatically identify $210,230$ domain-specific entities/concepts and encode how these concepts are interrelated with $411,860$ RDF triples backed up with evidence from the literature, without using any supervision or human intervention. Human evaluation shows our extracted triples are syntactically and factually correct ($81.69\%$ syntactic correctness and $75.85\%$ precision). The proposed framework can be easily extended to any domain that can benefit from such a knowledge graph.
